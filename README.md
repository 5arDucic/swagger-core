## Get started with Swagger!
See the guide on [getting started with swagger](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki/Adding-Swagger-to-your-API) to get started with adding swagger to your API.


## Overview
This is a project to build the swagger-core library, which is required for the Wordnik 
implementation of the Swagger spec.  You can find out more about both the spec and the
framework at http://swagger.wordnik.com.  For more information about Wordnik's APIs, please
visit http://developer.wordnik.com.


### Change History
If you're interested in the change history of swagger and the swagger-core framework, see [here](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki/Changelog).


### Prerequisites
You need the following installed and available in your $PATH:

<li>- Java 1.6 or greater (http://java.oracle.com)

<li>- Apache maven 3.0.3 or greater (http://maven.apache.org/)

<li>- Scala 2.9.1-1 [available here](http://www.scala-lang.org).  Note that 2.9.1 has a defect which causes problems with Jax-RS

### To build from source (currently 1.3.0)
```
# first time building locally
mvn -N
```

Subsequent builds:
```
mvn install
```

This will build the modules and sample apps.

Of course if you don't want to build locally you can grab artifacts from maven central:

`http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/wordnik/`

## Sample Apps
There are a number of sample apps in the `samples` folder:

[java-jaxrs](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/tree/master/samples/java-jaxrs/README.md) Java-based swagger server with JAX-RS

[scala-jaxrs](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/tree/master/samples/scala-jaxrs/README.md) Scala-based swagger server with JAX-RS

[java-alt-resource-listing](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/tree/master/samples/java-alt-resource-listing/README.md) 
Scala-based swagger server with JAX-RS with an alternate resource listing scheme

[scala-alt-resource-listing](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/tree/master/samples/scala-alt-resource-listing/README.md)

[scala-jaxrs-apm](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/tree/master/samples/scala-jaxrs-apm/README.md) 
Scala-based swagger server using wordnik-oss utils for Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

To run a sample app after initial compile:

```
# run scala-jaxrs sample app
cd samples/scala-jaxrs

mvn jetty:run
```

And the [Play2](http://playframework.org) samples:

[java-play2](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/tree/master/samples/java-play2) Java-based Play2 sample app

[scala-play2](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/tree/master/samples/scala-play2) Scala-based Play2 sample app
